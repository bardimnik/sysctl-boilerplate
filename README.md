## sysctl.conf boilerplate

This is a boilerplate of `/etc/sysctl.conf` kernel config file adopted for server use with any modern Linux distribution.  
This file contains some basic tweaks for different kernel parameters which can increase performance, responsiveness
and network throughput in the high-load scenario for web server, streaming or storage server, e.t.c.

Read this file carefully, adjust and recalculate values before using.
